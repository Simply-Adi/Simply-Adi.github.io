Hello Peeps! 
:smile: 

Here, I share glimpses of my journey into the World of Data Science and Energy Analytics. 





### Automation for Academia


1. **CertiPy**

-Description: With the help of code pieces from Stackexchange, I wrote a code that automates printing details of certificate recepients on a given template. The template (high quality image) is generated from its pdf version, which is obtained from powerpoint file (where the certificate design happens). Here is the [link]( https://github.com/Simply-Adi/Simply-Adi.github.io/blob/main/CertiPy.ipynb) to the same. 

-Context: PhD students are frequently involved in organising conferences, wherein arranging certificates is an important activity. Manually inputting recepient details is a mechanical task. **AutoCertiPy** aims to eliminate the time spent in such task. 

-Ahead: I plan to make this into a GUI app.
